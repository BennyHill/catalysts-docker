# catalysts-docker

This project contains docker images that are related to other Typelevel projects, and facilitates 
activities such as  testing, demonstration, quick start and the like.

As is common with most docker projects, these projects are layered on top off other projects, so please 
make sure you are aware of the underlying dependencies before use, especially in commercial deployments.

Current projects:

- [Artifactory OSS](artifactory-oss), pre-configured with repositories to run the [scala community builds](https://github.com/scala/community-builds)

## Participation

channels (mailing list, Gitter, IRC, github, etc.) to be welcoming environments for everyone.
